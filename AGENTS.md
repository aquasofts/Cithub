# Project Development Guidelines

These rules apply to the entire repository.

## Machine-local build instructions

- Before running any local Android build, read `AgentBuild.md` when it exists and follow its machine-specific JDK, Android SDK, Gradle, signing, device, and verification instructions.
- `AgentBuild.md` is intentionally machine-local because it may contain private usernames, absolute paths, device details, and other workstation-specific information. It must remain listed in `.gitignore`; never stage, commit, upload, or paste its private contents into public logs or documentation.
- After a successful local build, update `AgentBuild.md` with any newly discovered commands, environment requirements, failures, and fixes that will help the next AI on the same computer. If the file does not exist, create it locally without removing its `.gitignore` entry.
- Repository-wide rules in this file remain authoritative. Machine-local instructions supplement them and must not be used to weaken required verification or security rules.

## Prefer platform solutions

- Prefer stable AndroidX, Jetpack Compose, and Material 3 components over custom navigation, animation, gesture, or lifecycle implementations.
- Before adding a dependency, verify compatibility with the project's Kotlin, Compose, AGP, compile SDK, and minimum SDK versions. Use official Android documentation and stable releases.
- Keep custom implementations only when the platform component cannot satisfy a documented requirement. Record the reason in code or project documentation.

## Navigation and page transitions

- Use `HorizontalPager` for a small, fixed set of peer-level tabs. Each page must fill and clip to the viewport so adjacent pages cannot draw over one another.
- Use Navigation Compose `NavHost` for hierarchical screens, detail pages, back stacks, and predictive back. Let Navigation Compose manage predictive-back progress.
- Do not implement page navigation by partially translating two full-screen `AnimatedContent` children or by manually stacking screens.
- Do not use `PredictiveBackHandler` directly when Navigation Compose already supports the navigation flow.
- Every animation container must emit one layout root. Never emit multiple sibling form fields or page roots directly into `AnimatedContent`, `Crossfade`, or another overlaying transition container.
- Use standard Compose motion primitives and easing. Keep navigation animations short and interruptible, and test rapid repeated tab selection.

## Compose performance

- Use Lazy layouts for long or data-dependent collections. Supply stable keys and `contentType` when practical.
- For a small fixed pager, precompose adjacent pages when it removes first-switch jank and the memory cost is acceptable.
- Avoid I/O, preference writes, parsing, bitmap decoding, or other blocking work inside pointer events, animation frames, layout callbacks, or composition.
- During drag-and-drop, update in-memory state while dragging and persist the final order only after the gesture settles.
- Avoid starting a new spring or coroutine for every pointer delta. Prefer direct offsets during the gesture and one settle animation afterward.
- Avoid unnecessary full-screen alpha, scale, blur, and dynamic shadow layers during page transitions. Prefer translation and viewport clipping.
- Keep parameters stable and avoid rebuilding collections in frequently recomposed paths. Use snapshot state, immutable UI models, or remembered derived values as appropriate.
- Do not compose all records inside one Lazy-list `item`. Emit records as individual lazy items.

## Performance builds and profiles

- When generating an APK without an explicitly requested build type, generate the `performance` APK by default. Generate a Debug APK only when the user explicitly requests it or when debugging requires it.
- Do not evaluate animation frame rate using the Debug APK alone. Debuggable Compose builds include tooling and runtime overhead.
- Maintain an installable, non-debuggable `performance` build type with R8 optimization and resource shrinking enabled.
- Keep Profile Installer enabled and ensure the optimized APK contains `assets/dexopt/baseline.prof` and `assets/dexopt/baseline.profm`.
- The local `performance` build may use the debug signing key for device testing only. Production artifacts must use the production release signing configuration.
- Add or regenerate an app-specific Baseline Profile with Macrobenchmark when a suitable physical device or managed benchmark device is available. Cover startup, bottom-tab switching, opening grades and timetable, scrolling, and predictive back.
- Reflection-based libraries such as Retrofit must own their R8 rules in the corresponding library module's consumer rules. Preserve service annotations and suspend-function generic signatures, then smoke-test authentication with the minified performance build.

## UI correctness

- Validate forms at narrow phone widths and with long Chinese text. Text fields, captcha content, checkboxes, and buttons must remain inside their card and viewport bounds.
- Page transitions must not expose duplicated titles, overlapping forms, neighboring pages, or content outside the viewport.
- Preserve system back behavior and `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` while predictive back is supported.

## Required verification

For navigation, animation, or performance changes, run at least:

1. `:app:compileDebugKotlin`
2. `:app:assembleDebug`
3. `:app:assemblePerformance`
4. `:app:lintDebug`
5. `git diff --check`

Also verify that the performance APK is non-debuggable, includes the packaged baseline profile, and can replace the locally installed debug-signed build. When a device is available, test rapid tab changes, first-use transitions, grades/timetable opening, drag sorting, normal back, predictive-back completion, and predictive-back cancellation.

Before handing off a minified APK, smoke-test every Retrofit service family at least through converter creation. A successful build alone does not prove that reflection metadata survived R8.
